###how dependency is recorded 

When the dynamic linker creates the memory segments for an object file, the dependencies (recorded in DT_NEEDED entries of the dynamic structure) tell what shared objects are needed to supply the programâ€™s services.

###where share object file is searched
If a shared object name has one or more slash (/) characters anywhere in the name, such as /usr/lib/lib2 above or directory/file, the dynamic linker uses that string directly as the path name. If the name has no slashes, are searched in the share library search path. may be config in `/etc/ld.so.conf`.
